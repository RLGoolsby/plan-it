# Plan-it
## "THIS SITE IS UNDER-CONSTRUCTION"; aren't they all?

###  By entering specific criteria such as:

  * Width
  * Height
  * Sun
  * Shade
  * Dry
  * Wet

    * A few appropriate plant types will be selected from a json data base which will identify the plant's: botanical name, common name, image of the plant, and a description and display the options for your perusal.  

    * There will be a local nursery locater using information being drawn form 2 types of APIs.
